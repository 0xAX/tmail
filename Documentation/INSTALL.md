# Supported platforms:

Here are set of platforms that I've tested:

  * Linux
  * FreeBSD
  * DragonflyBSD
  * OpenBSD

Additionally only `build` was tested on:

  * Mac OS X

## Build from source code

Before you will try to build the `tmail` from source code, here
are some requirements:

- A C11 compiler (such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/))
is required.

- GNU make should be installed.
